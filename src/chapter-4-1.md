AI (Artificial Intelligence) and chatbots are revolutionizing the way businesses interact with customers. In this chapter, we will introduce the concepts of AI and chatbots and explore their role in managing customer expectations.

What is AI?
-----------

AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI can be divided into two categories: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and general or strong AI, which has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can.

What are Chatbots?
------------------

Chatbots are computer programs that simulate conversations with humans using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. They can be used to automate aspects of customer support, such as answering frequently asked questions, providing product recommendations, and addressing common issues or concerns.
